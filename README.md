# JsKern
## fully functioning kernel in ya browsa

First preview built in 2 days!

This in an example of a kernel built in JavaScript! 

~~It is (currently) inefficient, but it works none the less.~~

UPDATE: Efficiency increase!! (v0.1.3 => v0.2.0)

It has a command list, (in development) internet functionality, (planned) guis, and a fully functioning file system!

If you would like to contribute, make a pull request.
You can also make your own commands by utilizing the `import` command.
Just make a function attached to `window` in the 'scripts/custom_commands' directory, and put it in 'index.html'!

An importable command is already in this script.
Just run `import gayer`.
